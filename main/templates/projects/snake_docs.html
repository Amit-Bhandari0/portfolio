    <h3>Game Design Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      The game design sticks to a minimalistic style to retain the charm of the original Snake, while adding modern polish with UI elements, smoother animations, and sound design. The clean background and color contrast ensure easy tracking of the snake and food even during longer runs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The game is built to be accessible — the controls are simple (arrow keys), and the difficulty increases naturally as the snake gets longer. The screen wraps around grid edges, giving more room for movement, but self-collision keeps the challenge alive.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
    <p>The game was implemented using the following core systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grid-based movement</strong> using modular arithmetic for wrap-around</li>
      <li><strong>Collision detection</strong> for both food and self segments</li>
      <li><strong>Button system</strong> for start menu and game over interactions</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic difficulty</strong> with increasing snake speed</li>
      <li><strong>Sound integration</strong> via Pygame mixer</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      The game logic is designed around clean OOP principles — `Snake`, `Food`, and `Button` classes handle their own states and rendering. The use of a centralized `game_loop()` ensures everything updates at a consistent frame rate, with proper event handling and state transitions.
