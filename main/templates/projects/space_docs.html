    <h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
    <p>
      The player controls a spaceship moving horizontally along the bottom of the screen, firing bullets to eliminate incoming alien enemies. Enemies move as a group, shifting direction when hitting screen edges and descending closer to the player over time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When an enemy is hit, it triggers a falling animation line and explosion sound, adding visual feedback. The player has three lives and loses one if an enemy collides with the ship or its falling line touches the player. The game restarts once all lives are lost.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
    <p>The game utilizes the following systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sprite rendering</strong> for player, enemies, bullets, and UI</li>
      <li><strong>Enemy group movement</strong> with direction reversal and descent on edge collision</li>
      <li><strong>Bullet management</strong> with cooldown timer and collision detection</li>
      <li><strong>Audio</strong> with looping background music and event sounds (laser, explosion, game over)</li>
      <li><strong>Simple UI</strong> with start menu, play/quit buttons, score, and lives display</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      The game loop manages event handling, state transitions (menu, playing, game over), and rendering at a consistent 60 FPS for smooth gameplay.
