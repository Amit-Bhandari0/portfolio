        This Flappy Bird clone captures the addictive charm of the original with
        smooth animations, responsive controls, and classic pixel-art style
        graphics. Built with Pygame, it features randomized pipe gaps and an
        intuitive pause system for a polished gameplay experience.

    <h3>Game Design Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      The focus was on creating a faithful remake of the classic game that feels
      familiar yet smooth. Random pipe gaps keep gameplay unpredictable, while
      the gentle gravity and precise controls give players a fair challenge. The
      pixel-perfect collision detection maintains the nostalgic feel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sound effects and visual feedback, like bird wing flaps and scoring
      points, enhance player engagement. The pause feature allows casual players
      to take breaks without losing progress.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
    <p>The game was built with these key systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Event-driven pipe spawning</strong> using Pygame timers</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gravity and velocity</strong> based bird movement with rotation
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pixel-perfect collision detection</strong> between bird and
        pipes or ground
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Animated sprites</strong> cycling through frames for bird
        flapping
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sound integration</strong> for points, wing flap, and death
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The code is organized to separate game states (start, playing, game over),
      handling UI buttons, and rendering all assets efficiently. Timers and
      event loops manage game pace and animations smoothly.
